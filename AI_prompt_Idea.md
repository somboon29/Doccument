- Create a comprehensive Python script using the MetaTrader 5 (MT5) API that demonstrates how to open Market, Limit, and Stop Orders. Include functions for placing these orders, executing partial closes, and handling order modifications. Ensure the script is well-commented for clarity and includes error handling for common scenarios. Additionally, provide examples of how to use each function effectively within a trading strategy. Aim for modularity and reusability in your code, making it easy for users to adapt the script for their own trading needs.
